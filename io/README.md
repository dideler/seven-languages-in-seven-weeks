# Io

A younger language than most.
Steve Dekorte created Io in 2002 to learn more about language design.

Io is a [prototype language][prototype] like Lua or JavaScript.
A style of object-oriented programming where every object is a clone of
another, and existing objects serve as _prototypes_. The prototype-based
object models eliminates the distinction between instance and class.

In Io, everything is an object. Like Lisp, programs are data trees.

Io has rich concurrency which uses actors, futures, and coroutines.

Io is executed by a small, portable virtual machine.
Io is often used as an embeddable language.

The syntax is simple and the language can be quickly learned.
The libraries will take you a little longer.
